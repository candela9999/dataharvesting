However, process downloading files clicking works well downloading one two files. needed download 500 CSV files? happens need download data refreshed every 20 seconds? process manually clicking file simply feasible solution downloading data scale frequent intervals. ’s increasing amount data internet, ’s also increase tools allow access data programmatically. course focus exploring technologies.Let give example. COVID pandemic struck world 2020, paramount understand mortality rates causing general decomposition mortality (affecting males versus females well different age groups). team researchers Max Planck Institute Demographic Research set collect administrative data reported deaths country, regions, gender age. Now might sound like fun ’s actually awfully difficult countries uploaded data refreshed every day others weekly basis. regions given country might update data different schedule. website might different process getting know website can take time. Scale process collect data hundreds countries process collecting mortality data can become incredibly cumbersome: might spend hours web simply clicking links download data (see sample countries dates collect data ). Aside long tedious task boringly clicking links hours, chances ’ll also introduce errors along way. might confuse one region another assign wrong name CSV file, might skip particular country mistake might simply misspell country’s name, messing order files saving.example typical task want automate: wouldn’t great type robot automatically collect data different websites save files correct, explicity names ? ’s exactly team . created COVerAGE-DB dataset. help dozens collaborators, created web scraping scripts automatically collected data automated process run frequently needed. ’s managed created hundreds small robots work brought back data analyze. perfect motivation automated data acquisition extremely important tool every person works data benefit lot knowing tools.Throughout course, ’ll describe create upon basic formats data transfer JSON, HTML XML. learn subset, manipulate transform formats suitable data analysis tasks. data formats can accessed scraping website: programmatically accessing data website asking program download much data need frequently needed. integral part course focus perform ethical web scrapping, scale web scrapping download massive amounts data well program scraper access data frequent intervals.course also focus emerging technology websites share data: Application Programming Interfaces (API). touch upon basic formats data sharing APIs well make thousands data requests just seconds. Special emphasis made security ethical guidelines speaking APIs.big part course emphasize automation, way student create robust scalable data acquisition pipelines. step process, focus practical applications techniques exercise active participation students hands-challenges data acquisition. course make heavy use Github students need share homework well explore immense repository data acquisition technology already available open source software.goal course empower students right toolset ideas able create data acquisition programs, automate data extraction pipeline quickly transform data formats suitable analysis. course place contents light legal ethical consequences data acquisition can entail, always informing students best practices grabbing data internet.course assumes students familiar R programming language, transforming manipulating datasets well saving work Git Github. prior knowledge software development data acquisition techniques needed.","code":""},{"path":"index.html","id":"curriculum","chapter":"1 Introduction","heading":"1.1 Curriculum","text":"introduction Web Scraping\nWeb Scraping?\nTypes Web Scraping\nData formats: XML HTML\nPractical access XML HTML\nAutomation Web Scraping programs\nSelenium JavaScript based scraping\nEthical issues Web Scraping\nPractical exercises\nWeb Scraping?Types Web ScrapingData formats: XML HTMLPractical access XML HTMLAutomation Web Scraping programsSelenium JavaScript based scrapingEthical issues Web ScrapingPractical exercisesData APIs\nAPI\nFundamentals API communication\nintroduction JSON format\nCreate API (share )\nREST architecture\nAPIs way share obtain data (kind)\nAutomation API requests\nTalking Databases\nAuthentication ethical access APIs\nPractical exercises\nAPIFundamentals API communicationAn introduction JSON formatCreate API (share )REST architectureAPIs way share obtain data (kind)Automation API requestsTalking DatabasesAuthentication ethical access APIsPractical exercisesAutomation Data Acquisition\nneed automation?\nAccessing servers\nTechnologies automating programs\nAutomating cron jobs\nLogging tasks\nPractical exercises\nneed automation?Accessing serversTechnologies automating programsAutomating cron jobsLogging tasksPractical exercises","code":""},{"path":"test.html","id":"test","chapter":"2 Test","heading":"2 Test","text":"Whatever","code":""},{"path":"cross.html","id":"cross","chapter":"3 Cross-references","heading":"3 Cross-references","text":"Cross-references make easier readers find link elements book.","code":""},{"path":"cross.html","id":"chapters-and-sub-chapters","chapter":"3 Cross-references","heading":"3.1 Chapters and sub-chapters","text":"two steps cross-reference heading:Label heading: # Hello world {#nice-label}.\nLeave label like automated heading generated based heading title: example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}.\nlabel un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} {# Hello world .unnumbered}.\nLeave label like automated heading generated based heading title: example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}.label un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} {# Hello world .unnumbered}.Next, reference labeled heading anywhere text using \\@ref(nice-label); example, please see Chapter 3.\nprefer text link instead numbered reference use: text want can go .\nprefer text link instead numbered reference use: text want can go .","code":""},{"path":"cross.html","id":"captioned-figures-and-tables","chapter":"3 Cross-references","heading":"3.2 Captioned figures and tables","text":"Figures tables captions can also cross-referenced elsewhere book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.See Figure 3.1.\nFigure 3.1: nice figure!\nDon’t miss Table 3.1.Table 3.1: nice table!","code":"\npar(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))\nplot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)\nknitr::kable(\n  head(pressure, 10), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',\n  booktabs = TRUE\n)"},{"path":"parts.html","id":"parts","chapter":"4 Parts","heading":"4 Parts","text":"can add parts organize one book chapters together.
