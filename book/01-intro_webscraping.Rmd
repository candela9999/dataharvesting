# Introduction to Webscraping

TODO

- Install scrapex and explain the problem decribed in scrapex README that web scraping tutorial are doomed to be obsolete etc..
Webscraping is creative: no clear way to get what you want. Need to come up with creative solutions.

You need mad data cleaning skills and string / regex intermediatte. **Come up with a general regex that encompasses what they need to know to read this book and if they can't figure it out, they should study up on that**. Talk about string as a heavy lifter for the book.

TODO: You need to write the the entire webscraping part can be done without internet
TODO: Add a general script to save all plots in a folder for each chapter automatically (look at R4DS and their initial scripts)
